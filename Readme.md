----Learning GO----

1. Name your package name "main" if you want to create an executable. All other package names are libraries.
2. Use import to call the library to your code.
3. Use go run to run the go file.
4. A semicolon is automatically added at the end of a line.
5. All public functions, types and variables must start with an uppercase letter.
6. All private functions, types and variables must start with a lowercase letter.
7. fmt.Println("Helloo,", "gopher!") would print Helloo gopher, it automatically adds space in between. If you want no space then do + like fmt.Println("Helloo," + "gopher!")
